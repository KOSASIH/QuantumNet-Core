## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the following:

1. **Install QuantumNet-Core**: Follow the [installation instructions](../installation.md) to set up the framework on your local machine.
2. **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python programming will help you understand the examples provided in this tutorial.

## Creating Entangled Qubits

In this section, you will learn how to create a pair of entangled qubits using the `create_entangled_pair` function.

### Step 1: Import the Required Module

Start by importing the necessary module for entanglement management:

```python
1 from src.entanglement.entangler import create_entangled_pair
```

### Step 2: Create Entangled Qubits

Now, you can create a pair of entangled qubits:

```python
1 # Create an entangled pair of qubits
2 qubit1, qubit2 = create_entangled_pair()
3 print(f"Entangled Qubits: {qubit1}, {qubit2}")
```

### Explanation

The `create_entangled_pair` function generates two qubits that are entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

## Measuring Entanglement

Next, you will learn how to measure the entanglement between the two qubits.

### Step 1: Import the Measurement Function

Import the function for measuring entanglement:

```python
1 from src.entanglement.entangler import measure_entanglement
```

### Step 2: Measure the Degree of Entanglement

Now, you can measure the entanglement between the two qubits:

```python
1 # Measure the degree of entanglement
2 entanglement_degree = measure_entanglement(qubit1, qubit2)
3 print(f"Degree of Entanglement: {entanglement_degree}")
```

### Explanation

The `measure_entanglement` function quantifies the degree of entanglement between the two qubits, providing insights into their quantum correlation.

## Visualizing Entanglement

In this section, you will visualize the entangled state of the qubits.

### Step 1: Import the Visualization Function

Import the visualization function:

```python
1 from src.entanglement.entanglement_visualization import visualize_entanglement
```

### Step 2: Visualize the Entangled State

Now, you can visualize the entangled state:

```python
1 # Visualize the entangled state
2 visualize_entanglement(qubit1, qubit2)
```

### Explanation

The `visualize_entanglement` function generates a graphical representation of the entangled state, helping you understand the quantum correlations visually.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to create, measure, and visualize entangled qubits using the QuantumNet-Core framework. These fundamental concepts are essential for exploring more advanced quantum algorithms and applications.

For further exploration, consider experimenting with different entanglement measures or integrating this functionality into larger quantum circuits.
