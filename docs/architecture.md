## System Architecture

QuantumNet-Core is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components. This approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability. The main components of the architecture include:

1. **Core Modules**: These modules implement the fundamental functionalities of the framework, including entanglement management, quantum state manipulation, and quantum circuit operations.
2. **Integration Layer**: This layer facilitates integration with external quantum computing libraries (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq) and APIs, allowing users to leverage existing tools and resources.
3. **Utilities**: A set of utility functions and classes that provide common functionalities, such as logging, configuration management, and performance monitoring.
4. **Visualization**: Modules dedicated to visualizing quantum states, entanglement, and quantum circuits, enhancing user experience and understanding.

## Design Patterns

QuantumNet-Core employs several design patterns to promote code reusability and maintainability:

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating instances of quantum states and circuits. This pattern allows for the encapsulation of the instantiation logic, making it easier to manage different types of quantum states and circuits.
  
  ```python
  1 class QuantumStateFactory:
  2     @staticmethod
  3     def create_state(state_type: str, parameters: List[float]):
  4         if state_type == 'vector':
  5             return StateVector(parameters)
  6         elif state_type == 'density_matrix':
  7             return DensityMatrix(parameters)
  8         else:
  9             raise ValueError("Unknown state type")
  ```

- **Strategy Pattern**: Employed in the execution of quantum circuits, allowing different execution strategies (e.g., local simulation, cloud execution) to be defined and switched at runtime.

- **Observer Pattern**: Used for the visualization components, where changes in the quantum state or circuit can trigger updates in the visual representation, ensuring that the user interface remains in sync with the underlying data.

## Module Structure

The QuantumNet-Core project is organized into several key modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **entanglement/**: Contains algorithms and utilities for managing quantum entanglement, including entangled pair creation and measurement.
- **quantum_state/**: Implements classes for representing and manipulating quantum states, including state vectors and density matrices.
- **quantum_circuit/**: Provides functionality for building and executing quantum circuits, including gate operations and circuit management.
- **utils/**: A collection of utility functions and classes for logging, configuration, and performance monitoring.
- **integration/**: Facilitates integration with external libraries and APIs, allowing users to leverage additional quantum computing resources.

## Data Flow

The data flow within QuantumNet-Core follows a clear path:

1. **User Input**: Users interact with the framework through high-level APIs, invoking methods to create quantum states, build circuits, and execute operations.
2. **Processing**: The core modules process the input, applying the necessary algorithms and transformations. For example, when a user creates an entangled pair, the `create_entangled_pair` function generates the qubits and establishes their entangled state.
3. **Output**: The results of the operations are returned to the user, which may include measurement results, visualizations, or execution outcomes.

## Extensibility

QuantumNet-Core is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionalities easily. Key aspects of extensibility include:

- **Modular Design**: Each module can be developed and tested independently, making it straightforward to introduce new algorithms or integrate additional libraries.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Future enhancements may include a plugin system that allows users to create and share custom modules, further enriching the framework's capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples are provided to assist developers in understanding the architecture and contributing effectively.
