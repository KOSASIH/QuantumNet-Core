# Installation Instructions for QuantumNet-Core

Welcome to the installation guide for QuantumNet-Core! Follow the steps below to set up the framework on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing QuantumNet-Core, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: The package installer for Python, which is included with Python installations. You can verify if pip is installed by running:
  ```bash
  1 pip --version
  ```

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the QuantumNet-Core repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumNet-Core.git
2 cd QuantumNet-Core
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
1 # For Windows
2 python -m venv venv
3 .\venv\Scripts\activate
4 
5 # For macOS/Linux
6 python3 -m venv venv
7 source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository and activated your virtual environment, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
1 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and libraries required for QuantumNet-Core to function properly.

## Step 4: Verify the Installation

To verify that QuantumNet-Core has been installed correctly, you can run a simple test script. Create a new Python file named `test_installation.py` and add the following code:

```python
1 from src.entanglement.entangler import create_entangled_pair
2 
3 # Test the entanglement management functionality
4 qubit1, qubit2 = create_entangled_pair()
5 print(f"Entangled Qubits: {qubit1}, {qubit2}")
```

Run the script:

```bash
1 python test_installation.py
```

If the installation was successful, you should see output indicating the creation of entangled qubits.

## Step 5: Explore the Documentation

After successful installation, you can explore the documentation for usage examples, API references, and advanced features. The documentation is located in the `docs/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please check the following:

- Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Python (3.7 or higher).
- Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly by checking the output of the installation command.
- If you receive any error messages, please refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumNet-Core/issues) section of the GitHub repository for assistance.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed QuantumNet-Core! You are now ready to start developing and experimenting with quantum algorithms and applications. For further assistance, please refer to the documentation or reach out to the community.
